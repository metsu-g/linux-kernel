Linux kernel
============

This is the active linux kernel made by Linus torvalds (https://github.com/torvalds). I just forked the project since im interested in maintaining it and coding on it. Im probably going to make some of my own tweaks to the kernel myself. Feel free to support me by giving my a follow or a star on this repo
